## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Achievement Conditions

The system supports 13 different condition types:

```typescript
type ConditionType = 
  | 'level_reach'        // User reaches specific level
  | 'task_complete'      // Complete X tasks
  | 'habit_streak'       // Maintain X-day streak
  | 'stat_reach'         // Reach X in Body/Mind/Soul
  | 'total_experience'   // Accumulate X total XP
  | 'category_tasks'     // Complete X tasks in specific category
  | 'daily_tasks'        // Complete X tasks in one day
  | 'difficulty_master'  // Complete X tasks of Y+ difficulty
  | 'speed_demon'        // Complete X tasks in one day
  | 'consistency'        // Maintain consistent behavior
  | 'explorer'           // Explore different categories
  | 'first_task'         // Complete first task
  | 'first_habit'        // Create first habit
  | 'multi_category'     // Complete tasks in X categories
  | 'streak_master';     // Achieve X-day best streak
```

### Progress Calculation

Progress is calculated as a percentage (0-1) based on current vs target values:

```typescript
const progress = Math.min(1, currentValue / targetValue);
```

For multi-condition achievements, progress is averaged across all conditions.

### Auto-Save Integration

- Achievement progress is automatically saved to localStorage
- Visual indicators show save status
- Debounced saves prevent excessive storage writes
- Error handling for storage failures

## 🎭 User Experience

6. **Persist**: Achievement state is saved automatically

### Notification System
