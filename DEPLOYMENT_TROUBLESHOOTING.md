# 🚀 Scrypture Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

This document outlines the comprehensive solution for resolving deployment issues that prevented changes from appearing on the live site.

## 🎯 **Problem Summary**

**Issue**: Changes made to the Sanctuary component and pushed to GitHub were not appearing on the live site due to multiple deployment and caching issues.

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. Service worker caching old versions
2. Platform-specific dependency mismatches (Windows vs Linux)
3. Permission issues with build tools
4. Version conflicts between build dependencies

## 🔧 **Complete Solution Implemented**

### **1. Streamlined Deployment System**

Created automated deployment scripts that handle:
- Automatic version bumping
- Cache busting
- Build verification
- Deployment monitoring

**Key Files Created**:
- `scripts/bump-version.js` - Automatic version and cache version management
- `scripts/clear-cache.js` - Comprehensive cache clearing
- `scripts/deploy.js` - Full deployment automation
- `public/deployment-status.html` - Deployment monitoring page
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - User-friendly deployment guide

### **2. Platform-Specific Dependency Resolution**

**Problem**: Dependencies installed on Windows were incompatible with GitHub Actions Linux environment.

**Solution**: Updated GitHub Actions workflow to handle platform-specific dependencies:

```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm install --platform=linux --arch=x64 --force

- name: Install platform-specific dependencies
  run: |
    npm install @rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu@4.9.5 --no-save
    npm install @esbuild/linux-x64@0.21.5 --no-save

- name: Clear esbuild cache
  run: rm -rf ~/.cache/esbuild || true
```

### **3. Build Tool Permission Issues**

**Problem**: Vite and esbuild commands lacked proper permissions in CI environment.

**Solution**: Updated package.json scripts to use direct node execution:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "node ./node_modules/vite/bin/vite.js",
    "build": "tsc && node ./node_modules/vite/bin/vite.js build",
    "preview": "node ./node_modules/vite/bin/vite.js preview"
  }
}
```

### **4. Version Consistency Management**

**Problem**: Version mismatches between esbuild host and binary versions.

**Solution**: Added package.json overrides for consistent versions:

```json
{
  "overrides": {
    "rollup": {
      "@rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu": "4.9.5"
    },
    "vite": {
      "rollup": "4.9.5"
    },
    "esbuild": {
      "@esbuild/linux-x64": "0.21.5"
    }
  }
}
```

## 🚀 **New Deployment Commands**

### **Automated Deployment (Recommended)**
```bash
npm run deploy:auto
```
- Clears all caches
- Bumps version automatically
- Runs tests and verification
- Deploys to GitHub Pages
- Opens force refresh page

### **Quick Deployment**
```bash
npm run deploy:force
```
- Bumps version and deploys immediately
- Skips cache clearing for speed

### **Manual Deployment**
```bash
npm run deploy
```
- Standard build and deploy process

## 📊 **Monitoring Tools**

### **Deployment Status Page**
- **URL**: https://scrypture.app/deployment-status.html
- **Shows**: Current version, cache status, deployment history

### **Force Refresh Page**
- **URL**: https://scrypture.app/force-deploy-refresh.html
- **Purpose**: Clears browser cache to show latest changes

### **GitHub Actions**
- **URL**: https://github.com/arturplt/Scrypture/actions
- **Shows**: Build status, deployment progress, any errors

## 🛡️ **User Data Safety**

**Important**: All deployment changes preserve user data:
- ✅ **localStorage** - Tasks, achievements, progress remain intact
- ✅ **sessionStorage** - User session data preserved
- ✅ **IndexedDB** - Any stored data stays safe
- ✅ **User preferences** - Settings and customizations kept
- ❌ **Only build caches are cleared** - No user data affected

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting Checklist**

If deployment issues occur in the future:

1. **Check GitHub Actions logs** for specific error messages
2. **Verify platform-specific dependencies** are installed correctly
3. **Clear esbuild cache** if version conflicts occur
4. **Check service worker cache version** in `public/sw.js`
5. **Verify package.json overrides** are up to date
6. **Use force refresh page** to clear browser cache

## 📈 **Performance Improvements**

The new deployment system provides:
- **Faster deployments** with automated processes
- **Immediate cache updates** with version bumping
- **Better error handling** with comprehensive logging
- **Reduced manual intervention** with automated scripts

## 🎉 **Result**

**Before**: Changes took hours to appear, required manual cache clearing
**After**: Changes appear immediately after deployment, fully automated process

The Sanctuary changes from the original issue are now live and visible on the site!
